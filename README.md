# Threatened-Species
Tentative final project

(1) the question you like to answer, 
How is global animal/plant species geographical distribution related to conservation status. (latitude, etc. - how does this affect animal endangerment)

(2) the potential source of data, 
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species

(3) the tools you are thinking about using 
I will likely use threatened animal distribution data. With this I would like to construct either a global map or regional maps. Perhaps I can focus on regions with higher numbers of threatnened animals. I would increase reslution if I did so.  

(4) any questions you have about the development of the project.
I would like to answer a question taking advantage of the threatened species list, but am unsure whether an anthropogenic problem can be measured this way. I am thinking about how certain natural patters may make animals more suseptible to endangerment by humans. For example - decreased tree cover making some animal more likely to be hunted. 


amniote database - see if threatened species have life-history characteristics.
think about a narrower group than whole IUCN database - birds, reptiles 

find a way to filter them out then group them by species. 
your threat status is determined by what species you belong to

this weekend: decide on group - filter out other groups. merge them
