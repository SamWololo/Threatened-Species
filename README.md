# Threatened-Species
Tentative final project

(1) the question you like to answer, 
How is global animal/plant species geographical distribution related to conservation status. (latitude, etc. - how does this affect animal endangerment)

(2) the potential source of data, 
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species

(3) the tools you are thinking about using 
I will likely use threatened animal distribution data. With this I would like to construct either a global map or regional maps. Perhaps I can focus on regions with higher numbers of threatnened animals. I would increase reslution if I did so.  

(4) any questions you have about the development of the project.
I would like to answer a question taking advantage of the threatened species list, but am unsure whether an anthropogenic problem can be measured this way. I am thinking about how certain natural patters may make animals more suseptible to endangerment by humans. For example - decreased tree cover making some animal more likely to be hunted. 


amniote database - see if threatened species have life-history characteristics.
think about a narrower group than whole IUCN database - birds, reptiles 

find a way to filter them out then group them by species. 
your threat status is determined by what species you belong to

this weekend: decide on group - filter out other groups. merge them

Susy Meeting
must focus on one group. otherwise too data heavy. 
look at distribution of endangered species. 
focus on a certain threat status. there is an r package for this. install(rredlist)
find a package that gives you a list of animals that are endangered in an area
find: (1) group and (2) area
global assessment is not an option, too big. 
check geographical and taxonomic boundaries. 
check how many species are vulnerable in that particular area. 
i really need just a list of these species that are endangered in the US
can compare two different countries with the same habitat. can contrast this with climate and land use information. 
read the methods and supplementary information of the papers Susy Sends you
for monday define group, region, and which species you want to work with 
Find out if there are range maps with IUCN
check range maps of IUCN
